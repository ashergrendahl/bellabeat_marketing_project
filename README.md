# Bellabeat Marketing Strategy

**Summary:**  
In this project I assume the role of a junior data analyst at Bellabeat where I am tasked to work with the marketing team and analyze Fitbit data to see how people use fitness devices. I need to find trends in the Fitbit data that helps me inform the marketing strategy of the company by making data-driven decisions. 

**Tools:** SQL Server, SQL (T-SQL), Google Sheets, Google Slides

---

## What I did
- Imported the dataset into a SQL Server database and verified row counts.
- Cleaned and standardized data (handled NULLs, formatted date fields).
- Created a new table view that contained engagement groups of users based on how many times they have used the tracking features that the device has. 
- Created box plots in R to show the correlation of people who track data more often and living a heathier lifestyle.
